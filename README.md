# counter

My counter app. My second application after a long sabbatical. At times I feel like I should be doing more, but I should have started with things like this from the beginning to save me from headaches. 

Things to do:
1. Display the count &#9989
2. move the h1 and buttons to the middle of the screen &#9989
3. style the buttons &#9989
