# counter

My counter app. My second application after a long sabbatical. At times I feel like I should be doing more, but I should have started with things like this from the beginning to save me from headaches. 

Things to do:

~1. Display the count~

~2. move the h1 and buttons to the middle of the screen~

~3. style the buttons~

I took a look at the solution and there is a better way. Now without looking back, I need to do it. 

~1. Add classes to the button~

2. create query select all for buttons

3. use for each to look through buttons

4. create a function to change the text on the page

5. text color is green with positive numbers

6. text color is red with negative numbers
